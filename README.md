# Parallel_Logistic_Regression_HPC_Project

This project combines the concepts of Parallel Programming/High Performance Computing and Machine
Learning. It uses the GNU Scientific Library to facilitate the implementation of Logistic Regression in C.
The implementation is for both binary and multiclass classification problems. The project uses OpenMP
constructs in C programming for parallel implementation. It has been tested on a 12 core Intel Xeon CPU
cluster and gives a speedup of ~2.5.
